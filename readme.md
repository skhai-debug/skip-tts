# StreamElements TTS Skipper
A standalone program that skips StreamElements TTS donations. This program can be run in conjuction with something like [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to create a custom skip tts hotkey.

## Setup
Download the .exe from the releases page or build yourself.

You may have to install [.NET 5 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).

Go to your streamelements [user page](https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/channels) and get your overlay token.
